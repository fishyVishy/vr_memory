A building with each floor colored by the colors of a rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet)

Use an elevator to go up and down

The viewer can rotate the view, but can't travel (since positions can't be tracked by devices like Google Cardboard)

Each floor is distinguished by colors, patterns, and items (can be bizarre to create contrast and enhance memorization, yet to be tested)

Use basic geometric shapes for early stage testing, to see if the idea of the "memory palace" works or not
